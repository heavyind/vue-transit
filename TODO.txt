Sort out initialization sequence.
  The sequence logic here is pretty questionable.
  1 What should happen when it is delayed (by, say, giving a 1000ms setTimeout within the root component)? 
    Because the current situation is that the transit-ified elements appear (as in, opacity: 1), wait,
    disappear, and then animate in. Doesn't seem like it's the behavior you would expect. But what is?
  2 Should `initOnly` behavior be disconnected from initialization? Is initialization even necessary? Can
    a `once` flag simply be set on the first transitionend event? (Do they fire if elements are removed 
    before transitions are finished?)
  NB: Removing initialization entirely will obviate 1) above, and it's really the ideal situation if it
  can be done. But why the hell did I decide it was so necessary in the first place (other putting it in
  the root element so the set didn't have to be repeated on every single transition)?
